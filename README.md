Another garbage I produced with a friend of mine (giovanni)

This was a quick php "project" to get familiar with the said language and simple backend programming. I added some ctf-like elements to play with that dummie and it was all fun and stuff.

This is currently discontinued (for the moment). I am not hosting this anywhere so you can only test this locally.

# usage


IF EVER, do not reproduce ANY of this is your projects! There are many security issues (obvious LFI, potential SQLi, easy data tampering...) with the code here, mixed with terrible coding practices!!

But if you just wanna have fun (like we did) clone the repo as usual and setup:
- you need to import the pre-populated database (you can use `sqldump import` don't worry those are not real passwords) or create your own (figure it out)!
- then start your favorite local server or just `php -S localhost:[YOUR_PORT]`

PS: WEBSITE IS IN FRENCH, AND ALSO THE FRONTEND IS VERY UGLY!
